While sentiment is improving, the investment discussion still revolves around fundamentals margins, long-term competitive positioning, and how much future growth is already priced in.\\n\\n  \\nFor value-oriented investors, the main considerations remain Tesla\\u2019s ability to sustain profitability, scale its energy segment, and maintain cost advantages in a competitive EV landscape. A move above $500 would be notable, but the long-term thesis matters more than short-term price action.\\n\\n  \\nFor transparency, I personally monitor TSLA through a stock-futures product on my trading platform (Bitget) mainly as a way to track broader sentiment. This is not a recommendation just part of how I follow market movements while evaluating the underlying fundamentals.\\n\\n   \\nOverall, I\\u2019m keeping a balanced view and focusing on whether future cash-flow potential justifies the current and potential valuation levels.\",\n          \"Thoughts on Meta stock (META)? Currently down 15% and considering whether to cut losses Hi everyone,\\n\\nI wanted to ask for opinions on Meta (META) stock. I currently hold shares and I\\u2019m down about 15% at the moment.\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to decide whether this is a situation where it makes sense to hold long-term, average down, or cut my losses and move on. I understand no one can predict the market, but I\\u2019d appreciate hearing different perspectives.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on Meta\\u2019s long-term outlook, risks, and whether holding at this point still makes sense?\\n\\nThanks in advance.\",\n          \"Ads now in ChatGPT (Google, Meta affected?) With openAI announcing they\\u2019re about to start shoving ads into chatgpt there\\u2019s gonna be some takes about it being the end of Googles ad business or metas ad revenue, so let\\u2019s just sense check that with some numbers.\\n\\nChat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut, at last count has something like 900 million users (give or take) but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying. Ads will be served to the rest.\\n\\nAd business take serious time to scale. Example, Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $20b in sales for them. Which isn\\u2019t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there\\u2019s potential there but again, it takes time.\\n\\nAs for Meta, they\\u2019ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was  in a single quarter not a year. \\n\\nIf I had to guess in 5 years time I\\u2019d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there\\u2019s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it\\u2019s everyone\\u2019s consensus winner). \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

While sentiment is improving, the investment discussion still revolves around fundamentals margins, long-term competitive positioning, and how much future growth is already priced in.\\n\\n  \\nFor value-oriented investors, the main considerations remain Tesla\\u2019s ability to sustain profitability, scale its energy segment, and maintain cost advantages in a competitive EV landscape. A move above $500 would be notable, but the long-term thesis matters more than short-term price action.\\n\\n  \\nFor transparency, I personally monitor TSLA through a stock-futures product on my trading platform (Bitget) mainly as a way to track broader sentiment. This is not a recommendation just part of how I follow market movements while evaluating the underlying fundamentals.\\n\\n   \\nOverall, I\\u2019m keeping a balanced view and focusing on whether future cash-flow potential justifies the current and potential valuation levels.\",\n          \"Thoughts on Meta stock (META)? Currently down 15% and considering whether to cut losses Hi everyone,\\n\\nI wanted to ask for opinions on Meta (META) stock. I currently hold shares and I\\u2019m down about 15% at the moment.\\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to decide whether this is a situation where it makes sense to hold long-term, average down, or cut my losses and move on. I understand no one can predict the market, but I\\u2019d appreciate hearing different perspectives.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on Meta\\u2019s long-term outlook, risks, and whether holding at this point still makes sense?\\n\\nThanks in advance.\",\n          \"Ads now in ChatGPT (Google, Meta affected?) With openAI announcing they\\u2019re about to start shoving ads into chatgpt there\\u2019s gonna be some takes about it being the end of Googles ad business or metas ad revenue, so let\\u2019s just sense check that with some numbers.\\n\\nChat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut, at last count has something like 900 million users (give or take) but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying. Ads will be served to the rest.\\n\\nAd business take serious time to scale. Example, Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $20b in sales for them. Which isn\\u2019t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there\\u2019s potential there but again, it takes time.\\n\\nAs for Meta, they\\u2019ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was  in a single quarter not a year. \\n\\nIf I had to guess in 5 years time I\\u2019d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there\\u2019s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it\\u2019s everyone\\u2019s consensus winner). \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
